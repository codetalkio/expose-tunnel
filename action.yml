  selfHostedEndpoint:
    required: false
    description: No, unless `bore.selfhosted` was specified as the `service`
  secret:
    required: false
    description: Set a secret to be used for services that support it
  fallback:
    required: false
    description: Fallback strategy if the preferred `service` isn't available (e.g. self-hosted is down, fallback to managed service)
  blocking:
    required: false
    description: If the step should block and keep the job alive for the specified amount of time. This means you won't be able to use the output in later steps since the tunnel will be closing after the step.
